This is in Far North Queensland Australia.\nQ.Do you live in the wild?\n A.I don't live in the wild but just go into the bush to make these projects. Also I camp out here occasionally.\nQ. How did you learn all this?\n A. Researching books and internet plus trial and error.\nQ. What about dangerous animals in Australia?\nA. The only really dangerous ones in my area are snakes. Care must be taken when walking about and lifting things from the ground.\nQ. For the mud huts what stops the rain washing the mud walls away?\nA.

His first original track ‘Firestone’, released at the end of 2014, has now amassed over 7 million plays across SoundCloud and YouTube and over 65 million plays on Spotify, peaking at #4 in the worldwide Spotify chart. With a hotly anticipated album scheduled for 2015, plus a new live show experienced due to be unveiled at Ultra Music Festival, this is only the beginning for this 24 year old Norwegian prodigy.

(It is the shortest film ever nominated for an Oscar.)\n\nPES has also directed over 50 commercials for major brands including Google, Honda, Bacardi, Playstation, Samsung, Orange Telecom, and others.\n\n"PES puts a new spin on the familiar in a way that we haven't seen since Warhol worked in soup cans," says David Levy in Directing Animation (Allworth Press).\n\n"Clicking on a PES film is to open a safe and suddenly see a million ideas glittering and exploding," says Director Michel Gondry.

Recent highlights include his debut album going double platinum in Australia, a collaborative Lockjaw EP release with Chet Faker, which produced hit-single 'Drop The Game', as well as four ARIA Awards.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe, just copy this link into your browser - http://smarturl.it/FlumeAUS                                                                                                                                                                                                      	UUXAhoI7XO2kafTMjocm0jCg      	https://yt3.ggpht.com/-LU4ZR2vkzAk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8O65uVvpY_k/s240-c-k-no/photo.jpg        	160887014	463606	61
